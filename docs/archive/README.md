# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation and completed planning documents that are kept for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Archived Documents

- **[PLANNING-v1.md](./PLANNING-v1.md)** - Original project planning document
- **[complexity_mitigation_plan.md](./complexity_mitigation_plan.md)** - Completed complexity mitigation strategies
- **[hyperparameter_robustness_plan.md](./hyperparameter_robustness_plan.md)** - Completed robustness improvements
- **[ablation_results.md](./ablation_results.md)** - Historical ablation study results

## Purpose

These documents are archived because they:
- Describe completed work
- Contain historical context for past decisions
- Are superseded by current documentation
- Provide historical reference for the project's evolution

## Current Documentation

- **[Design Docs](../design/)** - Current design specifications
- **[Architecture](../architecture/)** - System architecture
- **[Patterns](../patterns/)** - Implementation patterns
