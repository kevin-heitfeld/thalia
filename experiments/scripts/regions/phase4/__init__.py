Phase 4: Emergent Cognition
===========================

This phase explores emergent cognitive properties from the full integration
of all five brain regions. These experiments test higher-order phenomena
that emerge from the interplay of the specialized components.

Experiments:
- exp13_spontaneous_replay: Memory consolidation during idle (hippocampal replay)
- exp14_mental_simulation: Planning via internal simulation (model-based reasoning)
- exp15_metacognition: Self-monitoring and uncertainty recognition
