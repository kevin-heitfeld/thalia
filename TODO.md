# TODO

- What is delayed gradification?
  - Ability of a system to go against its gradient

## Next Priorities

### Architecture & Infrastructure

- [ ] Sleep/Wake System 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - Already partially handled by oscillator frequency modulation
  - Could extract if needed for specific tasks
  - Not urgent given current capabilities
  - See: `docs/architecture/CENTRALIZATION_ANALYSIS.md` for analysis

- [ ] Clean-up config system
  - Consolidate overlapping config parameters
  - Remove unused configuration options
  - Document configuration hierarchy

### Training & Validation
- [ ] Run Stage -0.5 sensorimotor training with full oscillatory coordination
  - Use beta-gamma coupling for motor precision
  - Validate alpha-gamma attention gating
  - Test theta-gamma working memory

### Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Adaptive coupling strength (learn optimal coupling per task)
- [ ] Region-specific coupling (different strengths per region)
- [ ] Oscillatory pathology detection (detect abnormal patterns)
- [ ] Cross-region phase synchrony metrics
