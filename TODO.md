# TODO

- Implement synaptic scaling for all regions (currently only implemented for Cortex)
- Consolidate `STDPConfig` and `EligibilitySTDPConfig`?
- Implement spillover for all regions?
- Are current diagnostics sufficient? Add real brain diagnostics like EEG?
- Validate: All noise should be autocorrelated, not white noise
