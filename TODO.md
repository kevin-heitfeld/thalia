# TODO

- Remove Compatibility Imports (`docs\design\directory_restructuring_plan.md`)
- `docs\design\circuit_modeling_plan.md`

---

## Architecture & Infrastructure

- [ ] Sleep/Wake System 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - Already partially handled by oscillator frequency modulation
  - Could extract if needed for specific tasks
  - Not urgent given current capabilities
  - See: `docs/architecture/CENTRALIZATION_ANALYSIS.md` for analysis

---

## Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)

- [ ] Adaptive coupling strength (learn optimal coupling per task)
- [ ] Region-specific coupling (different strengths per region)
- [ ] Oscillatory pathology detection (detect abnormal patterns)
- [ ] Cross-region phase synchrony metrics
