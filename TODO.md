# TODO

- Sparse computations throughout?
- `docs\design\circuit_modeling_plan.md`

## Architecture & Infrastructure

- [ ] Sleep/Wake System 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - Already partially handled by oscillator frequency modulation
  - Could extract if needed for specific tasks
  - Not urgent given current capabilities
  - See: `docs/architecture/CENTRALIZED_SYSTEMS.md` for details
