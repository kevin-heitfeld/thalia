# TODO

---

- 🟡 Missing gap junctions and electrical synapses
- 🟡 Limited glial influence on learning

---

- Explicit oscillators necessary or should oscillation emerge? How to validate?
- `docs\design\circuit_modeling_plan.md`
- Sparse computations throughout?
- Consciousness / Self-Awareness:

  - How to: Mirror Test?

## Architecture & Infrastructure

- [ ] Sleep/Wake System 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY**
  - Already partially handled by oscillator frequency modulation
  - Could extract if needed for specific tasks
  - Not urgent given current capabilities
  - See: `docs/architecture/CENTRALIZED_SYSTEMS.md` for details
