*"She who flourishes"* — Greek Muse of spontaneous thought

A framework for building genuinely thinking spiking neural networks that generate thoughts through recurrent dynamics, form concept attractors, and achieve spontaneous cognition.

## Vision

Create an SNN-based architecture where **thinking is not input→output processing, but the network talking to itself** — recurrent dynamics that generate, test, and evolve thoughts spontaneously.

## Core Principles

1. **Thoughts as Dynamical Attractors** — Stable patterns of neural activity representing concepts
2. **Temporal Dynamics** — Spike timing matters, not just rates
3. **Hierarchical Time Constants** — Fast sensory, slow abstract layers
4. **Self-Referential Processing** — Output feeds back as input
5. **Embodied Grounding** — Concepts emerge from sensorimotor patterns
